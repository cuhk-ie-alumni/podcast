In this episode we invited Marco Leung, a graduate of the MScIE Programme in 2014, to share his experience with us. Marco is living in Hong Kong, and is currently the Head of Engineering at SEEK, the company that runs the job seeking Website JobsDB in Hong Kong. Besides his experience of transiting from a software engineer to an IT consultant to a management role, we also discussed about choosing to be an individual contributor or a manager as one progresses in his career path.
